# Azure Active Directory

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service. It enables
organizations to manage user identities, secure access to applications and resources, and enforce security policies.
With features like single sign-on (SSO) and multi-factor authentication (MFA), it enhances user productivity and
strengthens security. Azure AD supports integration with thousands of applications and provides insights into user
activities through reporting and monitoring. It plays a central role in securing and managing access to Microsoft cloud
services and other third-party applications.
