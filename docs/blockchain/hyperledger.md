#### Hyperledger

Hyperledger is an open source community-led project hosted by the Linux Foundation that provides a suite of blockchain frameworks, tools, and libraries for building enterprise-grade distributed ledger solutions. The project is focused on developing blockchain technologies that can be used to address the specific needs and challenges faced by businesses and industries.

Hyperledger is not a specific blockchain platform, but rather a collection of blockchain frameworks and tools that can be used to build a variety of different types of blockchain networks. Some of the most popular Hyperledger projects include:

- Hyperledger Fabric: A permissioned blockchain framework designed for building private blockchain networks that support smart contracts.

- Hyperledger Besu: A Java-based Ethereum client that supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and can be used to build private or public blockchain networks.

- Hyperledger Sawtooth: A modular blockchain platform that supports both permissioned and permissionless blockchain networks.

- Hyperledger Indy: A blockchain platform designed for building decentralized identity solutions.

- Hyperledger Caliper: A blockchain benchmarking tool that allows developers to measure the performance of different blockchain platforms and configurations.

Hyperledger is designed to be modular and flexible, allowing developers to choose the right combination of tools and frameworks for their specific use case. The project is also committed to open governance and collaboration, with a focus on building a vibrant community of developers, users, and contributors around its blockchain technologies.
