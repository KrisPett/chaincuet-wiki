Universe Sandbox is a physics-based space simulator that allows you to create, destroy, and interact on an unimaginable
scale. It merges real-time gravity, climate, collision, and material interactions to reveal the beauty of our universe
and the fragility of our planet.

#### Features

- **Fireworks**: Simulates colorful particle effects for aesthetic or celebratory displays.
- **Transform**: Adjusts the position, scale, or velocity of objects in the simulation.
- **Planetscaping**: Modifies the surface features of planets, such as terrain and water levels.
- **Laser**: Directs energy beams to heat, deform, or interact with objects.
- **Explode**: Simulates explosions by dispersing an objectâ€™s mass and energy into space.
